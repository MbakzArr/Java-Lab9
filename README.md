# Home Items Inventory System

## Purpose
This repository contains a Java program developed for the purpose of exploring inheritance by developing a data class hierarchy. The main task is to identify at least five items commonly found in a home, create a class hierarchy for them, and develop a storage class to manage a collection of these items.

## Task
1. Identify at least five items found in a home.
2. Develop a class hierarchy for these items.
3. Each item must share at least four common attributes and have at least two unique attributes.
4. Implement appropriate validations for all parameters.
5. Develop a storage class to manage a collection of these items.
6. The storage class should support methods for adding, removing, displaying, and obtaining the number of items in the collection.
7. Implement constructor methods to throw IllegalArgumentExceptions when bad values are passed in.

## Additional Information
- Vehicles are excluded from the selection as they have already been demonstrated in class.
- Only one collection will be used to store all different types of items.

## Implementation Details
- Each item type will be represented by a separate class.
- The storage class will be named appropriately to reflect the kind of items it stores.
- Validations will be implemented using constructor methods in each item class.

## Driver Class
A driver class will be provided to create instances of all item types and invoke methods of the storage class to manage the inventory.

This program was developed by Mbadaliga Arehone.
